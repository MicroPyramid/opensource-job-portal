    """Communicates with Google Data servers to perform CRUD operations.

    This class is currently experimental and may change in backwards
    incompatible ways.

    This class exists to simplify the following three areas involved in using
    the Google Data APIs.

    CRUD Operations:

    The client provides a generic 'request' method for making HTTP requests.
    There are a number of convenience methods which are built on top of
    request, which include get_feed, get_entry, get_next, post, update, and
    delete. These methods contact the Google Data servers.

    Auth:

    Reading user-specific private data requires authorization from the user as
    do any changes to user data. An auth_token object can be passed into any
    of the HTTP requests to set the Authorization header in the request.

    You may also want to set the auth_token member to a an object which can
    use modify_request to set the Authorization header in the HTTP request.

    If you are authenticating using the email address and password, you can
    use the client_login method to obtain an auth token and set the
    auth_token member.

    If you are using browser redirects, specifically AuthSub, you will want
    to use gdata.gauth.AuthSubToken.from_url to obtain the token after the
    redirect, and you will probably want to updgrade this since use token
    to a multiple use (session) token using the upgrade_token method.

    API Versions:

    This client is multi-version capable and can be used with Google Data API
    version 1 and version 2. The version should be specified by setting the
    api_version member to a string, either '1' or '2'.
    """

    __gsessionid = None
    api_version = None

        See also documentation for atom_client.AtomPubClient.request.

        If a 302 redirect is sent from the server to the client, this client
        assumes that the redirect is in the form used by the Google Calendar API.
        The same request URI and method will be used as in the original request,
        but a gsessionid URL parameter will be added to the request URI with
        the value provided in the server's 302 redirect response. If the 302
        redirect is not in the format specified by the Google Calendar API, a
        RedirectError will be raised containing the body of the server's
        response.

        The method calls the client's modify_request method to make any changes
        required by the client before the request is made. For example, a
        version 2 client could add a GData-Version: 2 header to the request in
        its modify_request method.

        Args:
          method: str The HTTP verb for this request, usually 'GET', 'POST',
                  'PUT', or 'DELETE'
          uri: http_core.Uri, str, or unicode The URL being requested.
          auth_token: An object which sets the Authorization HTTP header in its
                      modify_request method. Recommended classes include
                      gdata.gauth.ClientLoginToken and gdata.gauth.AuthSubToken
                      among others.
          http_request: (optional) http_core.HttpRequest
          converter: function which takes the body of the response as its only
                     argument and returns the desired object.
          desired_class: class descended from core.XmlElement to which a
                         successful response should be converted. If there is no
                         converter function specified (converter=None) then the
                         desired_class will be used in calling the
                         core.parse function. If neither
                         the desired_class nor the converter is specified, an
                         HTTP reponse object will be returned.
          redirects_remaining: (optional) int, if this number is 0 and the
                               server sends a 302 redirect, the request method
                               will raise an exception. This parameter is used in
                               recursive request calls to avoid an infinite loop.

        Any additional arguments are passed through to
        atom_client.AtomPubClient.request.

        Returns:
          An HTTP response object (see http_core.HttpResponse for a
          description of the object's interface) if no converter was
          specified and no desired_class was specified. If a converter function
          was provided, the results of calling the converter are returned. If no

        Args:
          text_query: Full text search str (optional)
          categories: list of strings (optional). Each string is a required
              category. To include an 'or' query, put a | in the string between
              terms. For example, to find everything in the Fitz category and
              the Laurie or Jane category (Fitz and (Laurie or Jane)) you would
              set categories to ['Fitz', 'Laurie|Jane'].
          author: str (optional) The service returns entries where the author
              name and/or email address match your query string.
          alt: str (optional) for the Alternative representation type you'd like
              the feed in. If you don't specify an alt parameter, the service
              returns an Atom feed. This is equivalent to alt='atom'.
              alt='rss' returns an RSS 2.0 result feed.
              alt='json' returns a JSON representation of the feed.
              alt='json-in-script' Requests a response that wraps JSON in a script
              tag.
              alt='atom-in-script' Requests an Atom response that wraps an XML
              string in a script tag.
              alt='rss-in-script' Requests an RSS response that wraps an XML
              string in a script tag.
          updated_min: str (optional), RFC 3339 timestamp format, lower bounds.
              For example: 2005-08-09T10:57:00-08:00
          updated_max: str (optional) updated time must be earlier than timestamp.
          pretty_print: boolean (optional) If True the server's XML response will
              be indented to make it more human readable. Defaults to False.
          published_min: str (optional), Similar to updated_min but for published
              time.
          published_max: str (optional), Similar to updated_max but for published
              time.
          start_index: int or str (optional) 1-based index of the first result to
              be retrieved. Note that this isn't a general cursoring mechanism.
              If you first send a query with ?start-index=1&max-results=10 and
              then send another query with ?start-index=11&max-results=10, the
              service cannot guarantee that the results are equivalent to
              ?start-index=1&max-results=20, because insertions and deletions
              could have taken place in between the two queries.
          max_results: int or str (optional) Maximum number of results to be
              retrieved. Each service has a default max (usually 25) which can
              vary from service to service. There is also a service-specific
              limit to the max_results you can fetch in a request.
          strict: boolean (optional) If True, the server will return an error if
              the server does not recognize any of the parameters in the request
              URL. Defaults to False.
          custom_parameters: other query parameters that are not explicitly defined.
