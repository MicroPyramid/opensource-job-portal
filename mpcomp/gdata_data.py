    The string that defines the recurrence consists of a set of properties,

    Specifically, the string usually begins with a DTSTART property that
    indicates the starting time of the first instance of the event, and
    often a DTEND property or a DURATION property to indicate when the
    first instance ends. Next come RRULE, RDATE, EXRULE, and/or EXDATE
    properties, which collectively define a recurring event and its
    exceptions (but see below). (See section 4.8.5 of RFC 2445 for more
    information about these recurrence component properties.) Last comes a
    VTIMEZONE component, providing detailed timezone rules for any timezone
    ID mentioned in the preceding properties.

    Google services like Google Calendar don't generally generate EXRULE
    and EXDATE properties to represent exceptions to recurring events;
    instead, they generate <gd:recurrenceException> elements. However,
    Google services may include EXRULE and/or EXDATE properties anyway;
    for example, users can import events and exceptions into Calendar, and
    if those imported events contain EXRULE or EXDATE properties, then
    Calendar will provide those properties when it sends a <gd:recurrence>
    element.

    Note the the use of <gd:recurrenceException> means that you can't be
    sure just from examining a <gd:recurrence> element whether there are
    any exceptions to the recurrence description. To ensure that you find
    all exceptions, look for <gd:recurrenceException> elements in the feed,
    and use their <gd:originalEvent> elements to match them up with
    <gd:recurrence> elements.

class RecurrenceException(core.XmlElement):

    Represents an event that's an exception to a recurring event-that is,
    an instance of a recurring event in which one or more aspects of the
    recurring event (such as attendance list, time, or location) have been
    changed.

    Contains a <gd:originalEvent> element that specifies the original
    recurring event that this event is an exception to.

    When you change an instance of a recurring event, that instance becomes
    an exception. Depending on what change you made to it, the exception
    behaves in either of two different ways when the original recurring
    event is changed:

    - If you add, change, or remove comments, attendees, or attendee
      responses, then the exception remains tied to the original event, and
      changes to the original event also change the exception.
    - If you make any other changes to the exception (such as changing the
      time or location) then the instance becomes "specialized," which means
      that it's no longer as tightly tied to the original event. If you
      change the original event, specialized exceptions don't change. But
      see below.

    For example, say you have a meeting every Tuesday and Thursday at
    2:00 p.m. If you change the attendance list for this Thursday's meeting
    (but not for the regularly scheduled meeting), then it becomes an
    exception. If you change the time for this Thursday's meeting (but not
    for the regularly scheduled meeting), then it becomes specialized.

    Regardless of whether an exception is specialized or not, if you do
    something that deletes the instance that the exception was derived from,
    then the exception is deleted. Note that changing the day or time of a
    recurring event deletes all instances, and creates new ones.

    For example, after you've specialized this Thursday's meeting, say you
    change the recurring meeting to happen on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
    That change deletes all of the recurring instances of the
    Tuesday/Thursday meeting, including the specialized one.

    If a particular instance of a recurring event is deleted, then that
    instance appears as a <gd:recurrenceException> containing a
    <gd:entryLink> that has its <gd:eventStatus> set to
    "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#event.canceled". (For more
